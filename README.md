# Data Structures and Algorithms
In this project I wrote the code for manipulating graphical figures where a set of pixels form an image. These figures will be part of a “pac-man”-like game. Figures moved by the computer will chase the user controlled ones. And user controlled figures in turn will try to get rid of the target figures. Fixed figures constrain the movement of the mobile ones.
